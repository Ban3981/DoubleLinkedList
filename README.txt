This project have one template class,and it represents a list.
Every node of list have pointer on previous and pointer on the  next element,so it is possible to iterate in both directions.
Also there are some methods that use lambdas,and they are used for filtering and maping of elements of the list(with forEach method it is possible to perform some operation on every list element,using lambdas) 
It also have my own written iterators nested classes.
